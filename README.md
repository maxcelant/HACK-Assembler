# HACK Assembler

This is a simple Python program that converts HACK assembly code into binary equivalent. The HACK Assembler supports the standard HACK instruction set, as well as the pseudo-instructions and symbols defined in the HACK specification.

### Getting Started

To get started with the HACK Assembler, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python 3 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Once you have Python 3 installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```
git clone https://github.com/maxcelant/HACK-Assembler
```

### Usage

To use the HACK Assembler, run the assembler.py script with the path to your HACK assembly file as the argument. For example, if your assembly file is named MyProgram.asm and is located in the same directory as the assembler.py script, you would run the following command:

```
python HackAssembler.py MyProgram.asm
```

The output of the HACK Assembler will be a binary file named MyProgram.hack that contains the binary equivalent of your assembly code.
